# js-diceeChallenge

This is a changing dice challenge made by Angela Yu from AppBrewery https://www.appbrewery.co/p/web-development-course-resources (check section12) in this challenge I made a website which shows two dices and able to change the dice pattern and text based on the winner of the game (bigger number of dice).
